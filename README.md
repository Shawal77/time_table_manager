# time_table_manager
 ##My first flutter app
 I got this idea of creating an application that is my reading timetable but on my phone.
 I want to also add a calendar feature so that I can add special events.
the result should be a page showing me my daily routine and notification for change of routine.
I want to put an evaluation which will ask how much of the time was actually spent reading and finally compute the statistics
showing me areas where im losing focus or time

## hopefully this week project goes well

### I ended up using allot of youtube and something called syncfusion. I never thought it was this hard to make a calendar app. 
day 5 of app creation
#### presentation Day tommorow
